### **General**


- We are both from film archives, so you may notice a general skew in that direction.
- You are strongly encouraged to code alongside, and run as much yourself as possible.
- Also consider trying to apply this to your own files! Some of the content is specific to archival tools and/or files (e.g. RAWcooked), but a lot of it can be used more generally.
