### THU01: *Python automation.*



---
class: contentpage
### **Python automation**


Today, we will be looking at what we have learned to apply to a (getting closer to) real-world scenario.

The film scanning team in our archive has just scanned ten episodes of the noted Australian documentary series "How To Drive".

They have delivered it to us as image and audio files and expect us to properly archive them. Luckily, they have been scanned as 480p JPGs, so the files are very small!

Before we begin, what is our plan of attack? What should we consider when planning an automated processing workflow?

### **Python automation**


A possible processing pipeline:

1. Validate film scans.    
1.1 Are all image files sequential?     
1.2 Is there an audio track present?     
2. Packaging.     
2.1 Bag the files.     
2.2 Store the manifest.     
2.3 TAR the Bag.     
2.4 Hash the TAR.     
3. Validate the TAR contents.     
4. Produce Proxies.     
4.1 MediaInfo on Proxies to produce a CSV of attributes.

There are no Python examples for how to do any of this, we are going to have to figure it out!
