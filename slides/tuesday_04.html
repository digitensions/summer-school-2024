### **1. Intro to Checksums**

Checksums are "fixed width" (i.e. always the same length) digital fingerprints.

They can be generated from source text or files!

MD5 for the string "Paul Duchesne"!

```sh
echo -n "Paul Duchesne" | md5sum
0396b497d1949e210d09692607734e97
```

MD5 for a DPX file!

```sh
md5sum media/0088600.dpx 
e0c39a37430fbacb9b7fb634580a1858
```

---
class: contentpage
### **1. Intro to Checksums**

Different operating systems have different ways of generating checksums, in order of complexity.

macOS

```sh
md5 media/0088600.dpx 
```

Linux

```sh
md5sum media/0088600.dpx 
```

Windows

```sh
CertUtil -hashfile media/0088600.dpx MD5
```


---
class: contentpage

### **1. Intro to Checksums**

An important concept of checksums is that they are predictable, with the same input they will produce the same output every time.

```sh
echo -n "Paul Duchesne" | md5sum
0396b497d1949e210d09692607734e97
```

```sh
echo -n "Paul Duchesne" | md5sum
0396b497d1949e210d09692607734e97
```

```sh
echo -n "Paul Duchesne" | md5sum
0396b497d1949e210d09692607734e97
```
```sh
echo -n "Paul Duchesne" | md5sum
0396b497d1949e210d09692607734e97
```


---
class: contentpage

### **1. Intro to Checksums**

However, any slight change in the input will, using the most popular checksumming types found in digital archiving, produce a completely different output.

```sh
echo -n "Paul Duchesne" | md5sum
0396b497d1949e210d09692607734e97
```

```sh
echo -n "paulduchesne" | md5sum
9a464f6d1e4bf783d7c5c48143c92d87
```
```sh
echo -n "Paul Duchesne" | md5sum
0396b497d1949e210d09692607734e97
```

```sh
echo -n "paulduchesne" | md5sum
9a464f6d1e4bf783d7c5c48143c92d87
```

---
class: contentpage

### **1. Intro to Checksums**

Checksums are not reversible, you cannot recreate the source from the checksum, but you can verify if the source is unchanged.

These characteristics mean this concept is used extensively in net and digital security.


---
class: contentpage

### **1. Intro to Checksums**


Example process: a user to a system (eg a website, database) creates a password, the system only stores the checksum.

```sh
echo -n "my_cool_password" | md5sum
a873aee995ffc1fe2634e63560d3aabb
```


When the user wants to log in again, they will re-enter their password, which should generate the same checksum... result: they can log in!

If a hacker steals the checksums (the only element the system has retained) they do not automatically know what the source password was, so they can't log in.

If the checksum algorithm (so far we have been using MD5) is not complex enough, the hacker may start trying to find a password which matches the checksum (e.g. a list of common passwords) or even "brute force" (eg "a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa" etc etc etc) until they get a password which matches the checksum.



---
class: contentpage

### **1. Intro to Checksums**


Note on terminology, generally "hashes" are used in the context of digital security/authentication and "checksums" for checking file fixity, but both use the same concept and are generally used interchangeably.

"File fixity" meaning that the file is fixed, unchanged, which is obviously a key concern for digital archives.


---
class: contentpage

### **1. Intro to Checksums**

One key difference between the use of these technologies for security and for digital archiving is that digital archiving is mostly concerned with accidental breakage (file truncation) while net security is dealing with intentional malicious behaviour (hackers). This means archives generally are using what would be considered "out of date" hashing algorithms.

MD5, which we have seen so far, is pretty ubiquitous in the digital preservation community. It has been around since 1991 and is considered "good enough"



What we mean by "good enough" - our main concern here are "collisions", where two different sources generate the same hash. What are the odds!

---
class: contentpage

### **1. Intro to Checksums**



There are `340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456` possible MD5 hashes, sounds pretty good! 

But once we factor in "The Birthday Paradox", the chance of a single collision is 50% every `18,446,744,073,709,551,616` hashes.

Birthday Paradox tangent: https://pudding.cool/2018/04/birthday-paradox/

MD5 is "good enough" for archives, in that it there are currently no AV archives holding this many files (not even close).

---
class: contentpage

### **1. Intro to Checksums**

A downside of using MD5 is that it can be quite slow to hash files, which can add up if you are generating checksums across an entire system.

---
class: contentpage
### **2. CLI checksum creation**

You can create checksums easily using the Command Line Interface:  

- 2.1 Whole file hashing with CLI tools  

- 2.2 FFmpeg file hashing (not truly whole file)  

- 2.3 FFmpeg stream hashing  

- 2.4 FFmpeg FrameHash  

- 2.5 FFmpeg FrameMD5  

- 2.6 FFmpeg FFV1 SliceCRC 

---
class: contentpage
### **2.1 Whole file hashing**

- SHA: sha1sum, sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum, sha512sum (Linux) / shasum  (MacOS / Linux)
```sh
sha256 file.ext  /  shasum -a 256 file.ext
```
- BLAKE2: b2sum  (Linux) 
```sh
b2sum file.ext
```
- CRC-32: cksum  (MacOS / Linux)
```sh
cksum -o 3 file.ext
```
- MD5: md5 (MacOS / Linux)  /  md5sum (Linux)
```sh
md5 file.ext  /  md5sum file.ext
```
- MULTIPLE CHECKSUMS: certutil (Windows Command Prompt) / Get-FileHash (Windows Powershell)
```sh
certutil -hashfile file.ext SHA256  /  Get-FileHash -Path file.ext -Algorithm MD5
```  
---
class: contentpage
### **2.2 FFmpeg file hashing**

You can also use FFmpeg to generate a single file checksum. 

```sh
ffmpeg -i file.mov -f hash out.sha256
SHA256=ce61d513ad70393e2ec0efc297b536cb4a90000898ea60e3fef98580e5b723f3
```
This command will create a SHA256 file checksum for the image and audio streams, and output it to a separate file called `out.sha256`. No algorithm is requested here, and FFmpeg defaults to SHA256.  
  
FFmpeg supports many checksum algorithms:  
- MD5, murmur3, RIPEMD128, RIPEMD160, RIPEMD320, SHA160, SHA224, SHA256
- SHA512/224, SHA512/256, SHA384, SHA512, CRC32 and adler32
  
<font color="orange">Practise:</font> Make checksums using FFmpeg hash algorithms using the `-f hash` flag. To avoid creating a file you can change the `out.sha256` to a `-`, and it will print to the CLI:  

```sh
ffmpeg -i file.mov -f hash -hash MD5 -
ffmpeg -i file.mov -f hash -hash CRC32 out.crc32
```
---
class: contentpage
### **2.3 FFmpeg stream hashing**

Many archives retain checksums for a file at stream level, separate checksums for video and audio streams.  

FFmpeg can generate a single stream checksum by using `stream copy` to read, not decode the stream:  
```sh
ffmpeg -i file.ext -map 0:v -c copy -f md5 -
```

This command will decode the first audio stream to generate an checksum and print to the CLI:  
```sh
ffmpeg -i file.ext -map 0:a:0 -f hash -hash sha512 -
```

FFmpeg has the `streamhash` muxer that will export a checksum for each stream, example below.  
The map flag tells FFmpeg to generate checksums for every stream:  
```sh
ffmpeg -i file.ext -map 0 -c copy -f streamhash -hash md5 -
0,a,MD5=acec0c1c506a2c4d6973e7d48a88e31d=N/A speed=N/A    
1,a,MD5=e97dea762ad0cebef700ef1ab969cdc0
2,v,MD5=e6413a0e4067a9817c2e35dd8870629a
3,d,MD5=a5c7909533674e7b81a0e10b0a9eff4c
```
---
class: contentpage
### **2.4 FFmpeg framehash**

Framehash from FFmpeg will print a list of all stream checksums to the CLI, or to a file  
.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/tuesday/images/Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 18.34.47.png" width="800">]

Framehash computes a cryptographic hash (default SHA256) for each audio and video packet. Audio is converted to signed 16-bit raw audio, and video is converted to raw video before the hash is computed. Other hash algoritms are supported, and is used for packet-by-packet equality checks  
```sh
ffmpeg -i file.ext -map 0 -f framehash -
```
As with FFmpeg stream hashing, if you add `-c copy` to the command it causes the framehash to generate checksums of the data as it's stored, and does not decode it. Not suitable for long-term fixity checking!  

???
Changing the pixel format will result in different has values event if the visual content is identical.
---
class: contentpage
### **2.5 FFmpeg framemd5**

FrameMD5 from FFmpeg provides frame level equality checks for your video and audio streams. To be used for immediate file assessment following lossless transcoding, and not recommended for long-term fixity checks!   

If you're making a lossless transcode then you would create a FrameMD5 of the source file, and another of the transcode. This command will create a FrameMD5 manifest for the first video stream and the first two audio streams of each file:  
```sh
ffmpeg -i file.mov -f framemd5 mov.framemd5
ffmpeg -i file.mkv -f framemd5 mkv.framemd5
```
You can compare them to ensure they are identical, using diff (Unix) or fc (Windows).  

```sh
diff mov.framemd5 mkv.framemd5
fc mov.framemd5 mkv.framemd5
```
If there is a difference between the two documents then the CLI will print out those differences

---
class: contentpage
### **2.5 FFmpeg framemd5**

Software `Meld` allow comparison of FrameMD5s, highlighting where differences occur between the documents  

.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/tuesday/images/Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 21.42.10.png" width="1030">]

FFmpeg also provide a FrameCRC tool which is similar to FrameMD5.  

---
class: contentpage
### **2.5 FFmpeg framemd5**

The BFI had problems with our lossless FrameMD5 verification for V210 movs being transcoded from FFV1 Matroska files. We had to call on some help from Dave Rice and the problem and solution is detailed in my blog entry [The Case of the Failing FrameMD5](https://digitensions.home.blog/2021/06/08/python-ffv1-to-v210-transcoding-script-using-ffmpeg/)

.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/wednesday/images/Screenshot 2024-09-17 at 19.48.33.png" width="1030">]

---
class: contentpage
### **2.6 FFV1 slice checksums**

The FFV1 codec can include `slices` within every frame of a video. It's optional to select `slicecrcs` are active, and to choose how many slices you want per frame. Video files start from 24 slices, and RAWcooked encoded videos range from 64 to 200+ slices per frame.  

```sh
ffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0 -dn -c:v ffv1 -level 3 -g 1 -slices 24 -slicecrc 1 
 -c:a copy output.mkv
```
For every slice there is an embedded CRC checksum, so for one minute of video footage at 25 frames per second you have 36,000 CRC embedded into the codec.  
.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/wednesday/images/checksum_map.png" width="800">]

???
Dave Rice makes a lovely comparison between stream/whole file checksums in AV files being like a country wide fire alarm for the services, that somewhere in Germany there's a fire. With FFV1 Codec, this is more granular, instead of it being a country wide alarm it shows you which state the fire is in, and which region of that state... Making that fire much easier to find/fix!
Really valuable fixity checking over time, possibly run at the point files are migrated between long-term storage.
Remember if you find any breaks you can try to fix them in MediaConch!! Amazing tools for our long-term video tape storage.
---
class: contentpage
### **2.6 FFV1 slice checksums**

The max slice count is visible in the file metadata, and confirmation that the error detection type is per slice.  

.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/tuesday/images/Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 21.25.41.png" width="450">]
To perform a fixity check of the file you just need to decode the video with FFmpeg again, and to display any FFV1 CRC mismatches in the terminal window use a command like the example below

```sh
ffmpeg -report -i file.mkv -f null -
```
Failures in the FFV1 codec will show as SliceCRC mismatches along with time stamps for accurate pinpointing of the problem  

.left[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digitensions/summer-school-2024-local/main/tuesday/images/Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 21.35.58.png" width="1000">]

### **3. Python hashlib**

As we saw before, we can generate hashes directly from the command line, but there are reasons we might want to do this in Python. For example, as part of a more complex media processing script, or if we want to hash a large directory of files and find where there are matches in a database.

We could use subprocess, but Python already comes with a handy inbuilt library called `hashlib`.

Example of hashing a string

```python
import hashlib
source = "Paul Duchesne"
result = hashlib.md5(source.encode()).hexdigest()
print(result)
```

Some notes on the methods we are using here! `encode()` converts from a string to binary data, which is required to hash. `hexdigest()` turns this back into a string - the hash we can store and use.

---
class: contentpage

### **3. Python hashlib**

Example of hashing a file.

```python
import hashlib
import pathlib

filepath = pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'media' / '0088600.dpx'

with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:  
    file_content = file.read()  
    result = hashlib.md5(file_content).hexdigest()  
    print(filepath, result)
```

---
class: contentpage

### **3. Python hashlib**

Example of hashing two files, and checking if they match.

Note, we have condensed our code slightly, but it is doing exactly the same thing.


```python
import hashlib
import pathlib

filepath1 = pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'media' / '0088600.dpx'
with open(filepath1, 'rb') as file1:    
    result1 = hashlib.md5(file1.read()).hexdigest()  
    print(filepath1, result1)

filepath2 = pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'media' / '0088601.dpx'
with open(filepath2, 'rb') as file2:    
    result2 = hashlib.md5(file2.read()).hexdigest()  
    print(filepath2, result2)

print(result1 == result2)
```
Okay, but say we want to hash the files in an entire directory! We don't want to have to create an individual statement for each file.
---
class: contentpage

### **3. Python hashlib**

Example of hashing multiple files in a "for loop", 

```python
import hashlib
import pathlib

for filepath in ['0088600.dpx', '0088601.dpx']:
    with open(pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'media' / filepath, 'rb') as file:  
        result = hashlib.md5(file.read()).hexdigest()  
        print(filepath, result)
```

Okay, better, but we don't want to have to write out all the file names!


---
class: contentpage

### **3. Python hashlib**

Example of processing a whole directory.

```python
import hashlib
import pathlib

dpx_frames = pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'media'
for filepath in dpx_frames.iterdir():
    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:  
        result = hashlib.md5(file.read()).hexdigest()  
        print(filepath, result)


```

Note that if we want to not print the whole filename, we can use `filepath.name`

---
class: contentpage

### **4. Bagit for Python**


BagIt is an open-source project developed by the Library of Congress to provide structures and tools, typically used to verify that collections of files have remained unchanged.

You could absolutely write your own Python scripts to create, store and validate checksums, BagIt is just a convenience method for fundamental digital archiving processes. 

If you want to create a "bag" as a one-off, we can just use the Python script provided by LOC:

```sh
bagit.py /directory/to/bag
```

If we want to do something more complex, we will want to write Python code which uses their Python code ourselves, which can be imported as a library.

---
class: tangentpage

### **Tangent 1: installing external libraries.**

Now, unlike the other libraries we have looked at today, BagIt is not pre-installed with Python (start a petition!), so we have to install it ourselves.


```python
import bagit
```

As we don't have the 'bagit' library installed, we will get a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bagit'` error in Python.

We can check out libraries using `pip freeze` to verify that this is true!

The easiest way to install is with pip, which is the recommended Python library manager.

```sh
pip install bagit
```

Note that we can also install a specific version if we so choose. This can be useful if there are changes to the library, and we want to be confident everyone is running the same thing.

```sh
pip install bagit==1.8.1
```

`import bagit` should now work.



---
class: tangentpage

### **Tangent 1: installing external libraries.**

Just be aware that we are now running other people's code on our machines, there is no 100% guarantee that they have not programmed the library to behave in undesirable ways.

From a security perspective, worth considering installing libraries which either have a lot of "stars" on GitHub, or are from people or organisations we trust (like Library of Congress).

---
class: tangentpage

### **Tangent 2: managing requirements.**

Now that we have started installing our own libraries, we have drifted away from the default experience of a fresh Python install.

We might have a project which requires twenty external libraries, and we want other people to know about these and to be able to install them all themselves easily.

The normal way to do this is to keep track of these libraries in a `requirements.txt` file in our project.
```
bagit==1.8.1
```


This way we can install all the required packages in one go, and with specific versions.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


---
class: tangentpage

### **Tangent 3: virtual environments.**

Installing those libraries is in pursuit of creating the same environment, so that code which runs should behave the same consistently.

But we can have multiple projects which require different versions of the same library, for example Project 1 needs `library 2.5` but Project 2 needs `library 3.4`.

Virtual environments let us manage the python libraries per project, which is pretty cool.


```sh
virtualenv venv -p 3.10
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

---
class: contentpage

### **4. BagIt for Python**

Walkthrough of BagIt for Python!

Copy the `media` folder to a `bag_test` folder.

```python
import bagit
import pathlib

bagit.make_bag(pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'bag_test', checksums=['md5'])
```


---
class: contentpage

### **4. BagIt for Python**


Tour of what "bag" looks like.



+++ Danger of "recursive bags" if process is run multiple times. +++


---
class: contentpage

### **4. BagIt for Python**


We can also load our bag and validate it is correct, meaning intact from when we bagged it.

```python
bag = bagit.Bag(str(pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'bag_test'))
if bag.is_valid():
    print('yes, we are good')
else:
    print('something went wrong')
```

Adjust something to make this fail!


---
class: contentpage

### **5. TAR wrapping with CLI 'tar'**

Great, so we now have our "bag", but what do we do with it?


Generally speaking, many archives will then "wrap the bag". 
TAR is a very old option (back to 1979) and widely supported means of wrapping files for storage or transport.


As you have now heard many times, we can either create TARs from the command line on a Unix-machine (Linux/macOS) or using Python (OS-agnostic)


```sh
tar cfv archive.tar bag_test/
```


---
class: contentpage

### **5. TAR wrapping with Python 'tarfile'**



Python has an inbuilt `tarfile` library!

```python
import pathlib
import tarfile

with tarfile.open(pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'archive.tar', "w") as tar_file:
    bag_files = pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'bag_test'
    for file in bag_files.iterdir():
        tar_file.add(file)
```




---
class: contentpage

### **6. OAIS**


Now is probably a good moment to raise the concept of OAIS, or Open Archival Information System.

This is a standard (although, importantly, conceptual standard) around how archives should store their material. 

I would recommend the DPC introduction to OAIS if you are interested: https://www.dpconline.org/docs/technology-watch-reports/1359-dpctw14-02/file.

OAIS describes three stages in the archival object's lifecycle:
- The Submission Information Package (aka SIP), the package entering archival control.
- The Archival Information Package (aka AIP), the package in archival control.
- The Dissemination Information Package (aka DIP), the package leaving archival control.


Because this is a conceptual or reference model there is some flexibility to interpret what an implementation should look like, but generally understood meaning that files should be stored in a state of assured fixity, with sufficient metadata to assess format conformance and playability.


---
class: contentpage

### **7. PREMIS**

PREMIS is another concept originating from Library of Congress, which defines an expected model for expressing information around preservation activity. This includes defining the entities of those involved in preservation activity: Objects, Events, Agents and Rights.

These entities also have expected properties, instigating the collection of the sort of metadata required to properly contextualise digital preservation activity.

If you were so inspired you could literally express this using their XML or OWL schemas, otherwise it could be a good reference to understand what data you should be considering for collection: who created this file, when? Was the filename changed?

### **8. Perceptual hashing, similarity matching**



Perceptual hashing has a different goal and is worth introducing as a concept. While checksum hashing for file validation is ubiquitous, hashing for content similarity is more unusual, and only a few institutions are currently doing so, to my knowledge.

---
class: contentpage

### **8. Perceptual hashing, similarity matching**


```python
import imagehash, pathlib, random, subprocess, tqdm
from PIL import Image

frames = pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'media'
for dpx_frame in frames.rglob('*'):
    jpg_frame = dpx_frame.parents[1] / 'jpg' / f'{dpx_frame.stem}.jpg'
    jpg_frame.parents[0].mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    if not jpg_frame.exists():
        subprocess.call(['ffmpeg', '-v', 'quiet', '-i', str(dpx_frame), str(jpg_frame)])

```


---
class: tangentpage
### **Tangent: F-Strings**

In the previous example you may have noticed that I was embedding variables into strings like this `f'{file} started'`.

f-string are a relatively new addition to make embedding variables into string easier, around since Python 3.6.

Older methods would have been:

```python
apple_colour = "green"
print('I like', apple_colour, 'apples a lot.')
```


```python
apple_colour = "green"
print('I like %s apples a lot.' % apple_colour)
```

But the new amazing recommended way, which I think does improve readability, is 

```python
apple_colour = "green"
print(f'I like {apple_colour} apples a lot.')
```

Note that that "f" at the start indicates that this is an "f-string" and any time curly brackets are used inside, they are embedding a variable.


---
class: contentpage

### **8. Perceptual hashing, similarity matching**

```
frames = pathlib.Path.cwd() / 'jpg'
jpeg_files = [x for x in frames.rglob('*') if x.suffix == '.jpg']
random_jpg = random.choice(jpeg_files)
random_jpg_phash = imagehash.average_hash(Image.open(str(random_jpg)))

print(random_jpg, random_jpg_phash)

result = []
for jpg in tqdm.tqdm(jpeg_files):
    compare_hash = imagehash.average_hash(Image.open(str(jpg)))
    result.append([random_jpg_phash - compare_hash, jpg])

result = sorted(result, key=lambda x: x[0])

print('most closest file', result[1])
print('most distant file', result[-1])

### **8. Perceptual hashing, similarity matching**

Where would this be useful for an archive?

If someone gives you digital material, it is useful to be able to check if it is already in your collection. Hashing processes like MD5 will tell you if you already have *exactly* the same file, but this will tell you if you have something which is just very similar, say a JPEG and a PNG of the same image, or a compressed vs uncompressed image.

I am also personally very interested in its use in determining where visual work has been sampled or featured in other works, to identify where clips or sections of video are present in other moving image files.
