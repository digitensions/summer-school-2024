### **1. Scheduling Tools**

Script scheduling involves automating the execution of scripts or programs at predetermined times or intervals. This is crucial for:  
- Routine maintenance tasks
- Automated backups
- Periodic data processing
- Recurring reports generation

Key components of script scheduling include the scheduling mechanism, exectution parameters and the script, programme or command.

```sh
# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name command to be executed
47 6    * * 7   root    test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.weekly )
#
```

### **1.1 Unix Cron**

Cron is the standard Unix scheduler for Mac and Linux. It uses crontab files to manage schedules, structing the timing parameters: `Minute Hour Day Month DayOfWeek Command`  

```sh
# MIN    HR    DAY  MTH  DAY/WK  USR   FLOCK LOCK DETAILS                                         COMMAND
 */15    *     *    *    *       root  /usr/bin/flock -w 0 --verbose /var/run/dpx_rawcook.lock    ${DPX_SCRIPTS}qnap/dpx_rawcook.sh
```
This example runs a shell script for automated DPX encoding every 15 minutes. The Linux Flock lock flock can help prevent multiple instances of a script from running concurrently, essential for maintaining system stability and data integrity.

Advanced cron features include:     
- Reboot tasks at system startup using `@reboot` prefix
- Environment variable setting by adding $PATH information into cron
- Log redirection to capture stdout/stderr `>> /path/to/logfile 2>&1`

To launch a cron editing session you can call one of the following:
- `crontab -e` opens a user's crontab editing. All users including root user can schedule scripts here
- `/etc/crontab/` is a system wide crontab intended for system scheduling purposes

### **1.1 Unix Cron**

```sh
# /etc/crontab: system-wide crontab
# Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
# command to install the new version when you edit this file
# and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields.

# MIN    HR    DAY  MTH  DAY/WK  USR   FLOCK LOCK DETAILS                                             COMMAND
 */15    *     *    *    *       root  /usr/bin/flock -w 0 --verbose /var/run/dpx_rawcook.lock       ${DPX_SCRIPTS}qnap/dpx_rawcook.sh
 0       */4   *    *    *       root  /usr/bin/flock -w 0 --verbose /var/run/dpx_post_rawcook.lock  ${DPX_SCRIPTS}qnap/dpx_post_rawcook.sh
 30      */4   *    *    *       root  /usr/bin/flock -w 0 --verbose /var/run/dpx_check_script.lock  ${DPX_SCRIPTS}qnap/dpx_check_script.sh
 0       20    *    *    5       root  ${PY3_ENV}  ${DPX_SCRIPTS}qnap/dpx_part_whole_move.py > /tmp/python_cron.log 2>&1
 */5     *     *    *    *       root  ${CODE}flock_rebuild.sh

### **1.1 Unix Cron**

When cron jobs fail it can be hard to identify the cause of the problem.
- Syntax error somewhere in a schedule line
- Incorrect numbers in designated column (ie, 8, or 9 in a day of the week)
- Unknown user or mistyped user name
- Insufficient user permissions for the command

When the crontab fails to run it can take some time to understand what the problems is:
- Restart crontab after making challenges
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart cron
  ```
- Check the logs
  ```sh
  /var/log/cron (CentOS)  /var/log/syslog (Ubuntu or Debian)
  ```
- Run CronitorCLI software which includes shell command to test run any job emulating cron, with debugging
  ```sh
  cronitor select
  ```

### **1.2 Windows Task Scheduler**

The Windows Task Scheduler is the equivalent to cron.  

Graphical interface for creating and managing scheduled tasks, which can also be managed via the command line (schtasks)

You can launch the Task Scheduler GUI from `CMD.exe` or `Powershell` by typing:
```sh
taskschd.msc
```

The Task scheduler offers hey features:
- Flexible scheduling options (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- Ability to set conditions (e.g., run only when idle)
- Can run scripts, programs, or send emails

Example schtasks command:
```sh
schtasks /create /tn "Backup daily" /tr C:\scripts\backup.bat /sc daily /st 12:00
```
This command creates a task named "Daily Backup" that runs backup.bat daily at 12:00 Noon

### **2. Environmental variables**

Environment variables are dynamic values that can affect the behavior of running processes on a computer. They are part of the environment in which a process runs and are typically used for:  
- Store configuration settings 
- Manage system-wide settings
- Pass information between processes
- Enhancing security by keeping sensitive data out of code
- Facilitate cross-environment development

Advantages when using them in your code:  

- If dynamic content changes they can change application behaviour without modifying the code itself
- They store sensitive information (like API keys) keeping them invisible in repositories
- The same variable name can be allocated across environments, but contain different information like paths
- Useful to help anage different settings for development, testing, and production
- They help with cross-platform code compatibility when storing OS specific data

### **2.1 Setting environmental variables in Windows**

Create a temporary environmental variable for current session only.  
In Command Prompt then Powershell:  
```sh
set MY_VARIABLE=my_value
$env:MY_VARIABLE = "my_value"
```
Permanent for the logged in user.  
Using Command Prompt then Powershell:  
```sh
setx MY_VARIABLE "my_value"
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("MY_VARIABLE", "my_value", "User")
```
System-wide using PowerShell run as Administrator:
```sh
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("MY_VARIABLE", "my_value", "Machine")
```

### **2.1 Setting environmental variables in Unix**

You can create temporary, permanent and system wide environmental variables.
Temporary variable to be used only in your current session:
```sh
export MY_VARIABLE="my_value"
```
Permanent for a specific user creating the variable. Depending on the shell being used you would add this to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc`:
```sh
echo 'export MY_VARIABLE="my_value"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
You can add a system-wide environment variable so all users/automations to easily access add them:
```sh
sudo echo 'MY_VARIABLE="my_value"' >> /etc/environment
sudo nano /etc/environment
```
To make the variable available you need to run this command then log in the server again:
```sh
source /etc/environment
```

### **2.2 Accessing environmental variables in code**

You have seen may examples of this already, particulary in the example bash scripts
```sh
"$ENV_VARIALBLE"
echo $ENV_VARIABLE
```
<font color="orange">Practise:</font> In a Python REPL try using the `os` module to create, get and delete variables.
```python3
import os

# Set an environmental variable in the current process only
os.environ['NEW_VARIABLE'] = 'my new data'

# Retrieve environmental variable
variable = os.environ.get('VARIABLE_NAME')

# Safely check if the environmental variable exists
if 'VARIABLE_NAME' in os.environ:
    return True
else:
    return False

# To delete an environmental variable in current process only
if 'NEW_VARIABLE' in os.environ:
    del os.environ['NEW_VARIABLE']
```

### **2.2 Accessing environmental variables in code**

Python's `python-dotenv` module is often used to store sensitive information. This data is stored in a '.env' file which can be excluded from version control. They can also be useful if you need to keep environmental variable separate between different stagings on one server, when running development, testing and production environments.

```python3
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environmental variables from a .env file
load_dotenv()

# Access the variables
secret_key = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
```

### **3.1 RESTful API basics**

REST (Representational State Transfer) API of API that allows two systems to exchange information over the internet or a network. It follows a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications. It's an approach to building APIs that uses HTTP methods to operate on resources, typically represented as URLs.  

Key Characteristics of REST APIs:  

- Stateless: Each request contains all necessary information.
- Client-Server: Separation of concerns between client and server.
- Cacheable: Responses can be cached to improve efficiency.
- Uniform Interface: Consistent way to interact with resources.
- Layered System: Client doesn't know or care how many layers are between it and the server.
